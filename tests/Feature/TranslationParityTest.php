/*
 * Every language against English.
 *
 * Twenty-six of the thirty languages sit at exactly the same 2,921 keys, which
 * is what it looks like when a set of files is generated once and never touched
 * again. Chasing all of it down in one go is not realistic, so this test does
 * the next best thing: it writes today's gap down and fails when a gap grows.
 *
 * That means an English string added tomorrow cannot quietly widen the hole in
 * twenty-eight languages. Translate it, or lower the number here on purpose.
 * The numbers may only ever go down.
