 * need to do the same thing by hand, worked out from the controller and the
 * verb: GET reads, POST writes, and the few actions that create or delete are
 * named as such.
 *
 * An endpoint whose controller is not listed here needs a full administrator.
 * That way a controller added later is closed until somebody decides what it
